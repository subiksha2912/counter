# counter
Verilog RTL design of an 8-bit asynchronous (ripple) counter with testbench and simulation waveform.

This project implements an 8-bit asynchronous (ripple) counter using Verilog HDL.
The counter is verified using a testbench, and the functionality is validated through simulation waveforms.

In an asynchronous counter, each flip-flop is triggered by the output of the previous flip-flop, rather than a common clock.
